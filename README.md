### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Just recently found out about these pages. And will try to make something pretty out of them (As pretty as a Java dev can, that is).

Mostly will post stuff I build at work. Kind of a history, so I don't forget my own code. Content will be released in ENglish, but will surely build, at some point, a way switch between Enslish and Spanish.

Till then, this will be probably full of random, probably half hacked together code.
