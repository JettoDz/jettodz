### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Sup.

I've been a developer since October-ish 2020. Worked mostly in Java (Spring) with SQL databases, splashes of Bash, JS, C#, TS, Rust(NEWðŸŽ‰), Python, and PHP, and I've touched a bit of Ruby, Go, Kotlin, and Groovy with no particular goal. Well, I was trying Ruby to make a template for a personal blog/portfolio. 

I like to think my code can be improved and that I will continue to improve the more I code. I'm also the guy who doesn't go much outside his comfort zone but is interested in a bunch of new things and will probably try them, eventually. Say, I've had this weird need to look into Rust for whatever reason, and I've almost doubled up learning full JS stack.

I've worked in a small team building some apps as a Backend Java dev and Server Admin, and sometimes go all out as Full stack. 

Currently I'm in the âœ¨_wonderful_âœ¨ world of LX IT Support for a big player, debugging .NET microservices and providing reports from Oracle DB, losing sleep on the seemengly unavoidable change from writing to managing and debating which my next steps should be.

Anyway, I'm learning and I hope to get involved with smarter people than me. I don't really mind changing what technology I use, it's just frustrating when stuff doesn't work out as "easily" as one expects amirite?
